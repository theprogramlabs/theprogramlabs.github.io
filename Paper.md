# The Program Labs website model

The Program Labs mission is to transform how organizations build and operate entrepreneurship programs. We offers two services.

1. **Builder Programs**: We work with nonprofits, foundations, and social impact organizations to build entrepreneurship and workforce training programs.
2. **Advise Programs**: We guide leaders on how to conceptualize what they need to build based on the needs of the community and their organization.

What we don't do:

-   We don't fund or do fund raising.
-   We don't advice using logic models. We focus on launch hurdles.

### Intersection of three concepts

1. Execution, productivity engineering, operations. After funding launch, deployment (boots on the ground)
2. Business Accelerators, Entrepreneurship
3. Underserved or underinvested communities
